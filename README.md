# Polygon Liquidity Mining

Stakers with PLM can stake inside the PLMStakingContract to redeem their WMATIC rewards!

Stakers must be whitelisted.

Every 1 PLM staked at any time in a 30 day epoch is linearly redeemable for 1 WMATIC with linear release, such that it is fully available at the end of that epoch.

In the subsequent epochs users can redeem unharvested WMATIC from previous epochs and stake/redeem for their allowance in the current epoch.
